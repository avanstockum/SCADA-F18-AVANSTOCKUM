**REPORT:** 

 **I. Analysis** 
 
To better understand SCADA systems and Programmable Logic Controllers, the course lectures, case studies, and labs provided a good foundation. The first LogixPro lab worksheet helped in understanding the software and how to use it properly. Completing the garage door and silo proved to be slightly more challenging. Additional research online in addition to the provided readings proved to be incredibly helpful. I was able to better understand the ladder logic and the functions of each of the symbols that could be used within the rungs to build the simulation. The garage door worked simply enough, turning the motor on or off to move up or down based on whether you were attempting to open or close it. However, I found inplementing the timer and changing the speed of the lights to be more difficult to implement. I was able to find videos online that helped me to understand the logic and what each character symbol was doing as it moved through the program. These videos, the lectures, and the additional research helped me to complete the garage door simulation successfull, and without causing any fires! 

The silo simulation was simple to start, but State B was difficult for me. I found it hard to figure out how to get the motor and fill mechanism to stop once State B was implemented until the start button was pressed again. I tried several different strategies to get this to work and moved rungs, inputs, outputs, and other mechanisms to try to find the solution. Using the same aforementioned strategy, I turned to my own internet research to find videos and examples online to help be in creating the solution in my own program. Eventually, I was able to find the appropriate solutions but found it more time consuming than I originally anticipated. I learned a lot about PLC's and ladder logic by doing these labs and was really grateful for the instructions provided and online resources I discovered. 

From my expereince the modbus labs were more educational and more closely related to this course and future courses. I really enjoyed walking through the provided guidance and following the steps to learn and work through the labs. Using metasploit was really interesting and I love the different images in terminal when you first start using the tool. It was fascinating to see the different ways I could make changes to the slave VM from the master VM. Additionally, the ways I could make changes using terminal and metasploit through Kali were interesting. 
 
 **II. Methodologies** 
 
The methodologies I used both successfully and unsuccessfully were the provided lab guidance, outside research, metasploit and python manuals, and the help of classmates. I found all of these resources to be incredibly helpful and I learned a lot from each resource. Without having had any experience with metasploit or even Python, these labs proved to be more time consuming than I originall anticipated. I really did enjoy working with metasploit's msf console to interface with modbus. It was an interesting learning experience and I am excited to practice more Python moving forward. From my understanding, metasplot will be a useful tool for the spring penetration testing course, which seems like it will be another unique learning experience.
