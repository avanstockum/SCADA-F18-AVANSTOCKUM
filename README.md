**REPORT:** 

 **I. Analysis** 
 
To better understand SCADA systems and Programmable Logic Controllers, the course lectures, case studies, and labs provided a good foundation. The first LogixPro lab worksheet helped in understanding the software and how to use it properly. Completing the garage door and silo proved to be slightly more challenging. Additional research online in addition to the provided readings proved to be incredibly helpful. I was able to better understand the ladder logic and the functions of each of the symbols that could be used within the rungs to build the simulation. The garage door worked simply enough, turning the motor on or off to move up or down based on whether you were attempting to open or close it. However, I found inplementing the timer and changing the speed of the lights to be more difficult to implement. I was able to find videos online that helped me to understand the logic and what each character symbol was doing as it moved through the program. These videos, the lectures, and the additional research helped me to complete the garage door simulation successfull, and without causing any fires! 

The silo simulation was simple to start, but State B was difficult for me. I found it hard to figure out how to get the motor and fill mechanism to stop once State B was implemented until the start button was pressed again. I tried several different strategies to get this to work and moved rungs, inputs, outputs, and other mechanisms to try to find the solution. Using the same aforementioned strategy, I turned to my own internet research to find videos and examples online to help be in creating the solution in my own program. Eventually, I was able to find the appropriate solutions but found it more time consuming than I originally anticipated. I learned a lot about PLC's and ladder logic by doing these labs and was really grateful for the instructions provided and online resources I discovered.
